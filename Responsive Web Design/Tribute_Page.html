        <p> A mechanical engineer who dreamt of becoming an actor and quit his college midway to fullfil his dreams. Started his careeer as a background dancer in the show-business and got this first break in a TV series in 2008. Just within a year he bagged another TV series which put his name in front of the world and from there it just got bigger and better for him.</p>
        <p> After 5 successfull years in telivision industry he quit the series to try his luck in Bollywood and in 2013 debuted in a bollywood movie named Kai Po Che! He won the best debutant male award in Screen awards and his acting career in bollywood just sky rocketed after that followed by critically acclaimed movies like MS Dhoni: untold story, Kedarnath, Sonchirya, Chhichhore to name a few.</p>
        <p> More than his professional life his personal life inspired me in many ways. He wasn't like other celebreties in the industry. There was something different about him that struck not only me but many others in a similar manner. He was very passionate about astrophysics and technology. He was so much into it that not only he had a huge telescope at his residence but he had purchased a piece of land on moon with co-ordiantes that match with India's co-ordinate on Earth. He was also an avid reader and you connect with his fans over social-media and inspire them to read, learn new things and discuss with them on topics that would interest many of us.</p>
        <p> I idolised him on so many levels. He is amd will always remain my inspiration, my motivation and I wish to full his wishlist in my bestest way possible.</p>
        <p> If you wish to see his journey till date here is the link to his <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/sushantsinghrajput/" target="_blank"> instagram profile. </a></p>
